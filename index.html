            <p>This past June 2020, TriMet adapted the quickly-growing SeatSwitch™ that is sweeping the nation. If you have been living under a rock and/or you don't ride public transit (shame on you!), you may not have heard of this new technology called the SeatSwitch™. With the power of the SeatSwitch™, SeatPeek gathers data regarding the amount of occupied and unoccupied seats on a bus or MAX. This way, riders can see how crowded a bus is before boarding</p>

          <h1>SeatPeek Essential For Those with Disabilities</h1>
          <p>SeatPeek is changing lives of those with disabilities! Everyone is chatting about this new occupancy metric developed by SeatPeek that displays how crowded a bus or train is. Cities around the US are starting to utilize this new tool. How does this affect the disability community? People with physical disabilities can now view the occupancy of a train or bus before it arrives to see if there are seats available. This new metric not only helps those who are physically diabled, it also helps able-bodied people who want a seat, or people who get claustrophobic. People are buzzing about how SeatPeek is helping them save time. They aren't waiting at bus stops only to realize that they can't get on because the bus is full.</p>
          <p>A national survey shows that the US has seen a 25% increase of people choosing to use public transit instead of driving or using a ride share company. This leads to less cars on the road, which results in less C02 emissions. SeatPeek also donates a portion of their profits to Tree Musketeers, an organization that plants trees in urban cities. Tree Musketeers has planted over 2,000 trees in cities from San Francisco to New York City in the past three years. SeatPeek also offers paid internships to recent high school graduates who are interested in bettering public transit in America</p>
